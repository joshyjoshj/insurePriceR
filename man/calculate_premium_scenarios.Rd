\title{Calculate Insurance Premiums for Multiple Risk Scenarios}
\usage{
calculate_premium_scenarios(df, scenarios = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A data frame containing the following required columns:
\itemize{
  \item age: Numeric vector of customer ages
  \item bmi: Numeric vector of customer BMI values
  \item smoking_status: Character vector with "y" for smokers, "n" for non-smokers
  \item pre_existing_conditions: Character vector of conditions (one of: "arthritis",
        "diabetes_type_2", "heart_disease", "asthma", "hypertension", "none")
  \item annual_premium: Numeric vector of current annual premiums
}}

\item{scenarios}{Optional list of custom scenarios. If NULL, uses default scenarios.
Each scenario should be a list containing the following elements:
\itemize{
  \item age_base: Base age for calculations
  \item age_factor: Factor to adjust for age differences
  \item bmi_base: Base BMI for calculations
  \item bmi_factor: Factor to adjust for BMI differences
  \item smoker_penalty: Additional risk factor for smokers
  \item arthritis_factor: Risk factor for arthritis
  \item diabetes_factor: Risk factor for diabetes
  \item heart_disease_factor: Risk factor for heart disease
  \item asthma_factor: Risk factor for asthma
  \item hypertension_factor: Risk factor for hypertension
  \item none_factor: Risk factor (usually negative) for no conditions
}}
}
\value{
A data frame containing all original columns plus additional columns for each scenario:
  \itemize{
    \item conservative_premium: Premium calculated using conservative risk factors
    \item conservative_risk_score: Risk score under conservative scenario
    \item moderate_premium: Premium calculated using moderate risk factors
    \item moderate_risk_score: Risk score under moderate scenario
    \item aggressive_premium: Premium calculated using aggressive risk factors
    \item aggressive_risk_score: Risk score under aggressive scenario
  }
}
\description{
Calculates insurance premiums and risk scores for multiple predefined scenarios
(conservative, moderate, and aggressive) using different risk factor combinations.
Each scenario applies different weightings to age, BMI, smoking status, and
pre-existing conditions.
